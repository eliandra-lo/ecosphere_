                <p>• Every donation received through our GCash platform will be divided equally among the three organizations dedicated to conservation efforts. This means that each organization will receive one-third of your contribution.</p>
                <p class="formula-text">Formula for Equal Distribution of Donations</p>
                <p>Let:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>D = Total Donation Amount</li>
                    <li>O1 = Amount allocated to Organization 1</li>
                    <li>O2 = Amount allocated to Organization 2</li>
                    <li>O3 = Amount allocated to Organization 3</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The formula for equal distribution is:</p>
                <p><strong>O1 = O2 = O3 = D / 3</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <p><strong>Example Calculation</strong></p>
                <p>If the total donation amount (D) is ₱300, the allocation would be:</p>
                <p><strong>O1 = O2 = O3 = 300 / 3 = ₱100</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each organization will receive one-third of the total donation amount.</li>
                    <li>This ensures that your contribution is equally supporting all three organizations dedicated to conservation efforts.</li>
